# ML-in-C++
#without using any modulus, only in for loop.
 # linear regression
// In this program i have made a simple linear regression model of two variable i.e. y =mx+b.
// And by using gradient update same as machine learning model this program automatically update the value of m and b in each iteration.
// this program is only prototype of house price predicting model.
// let us suppose the value of house is y , and the value of house depends upon area of land ie x and  b is any constant prameters in our program.
// And if we feed the value of price and area, this model will predict the corelation between how land area is linearly depends upon price.
// This program suppose price and area are linearly dependent.
 # logisctic regression
 // In this model i made a simple logistic regression.
## This can be modefied to any any machine learning model by simple changing lost and cost function.
